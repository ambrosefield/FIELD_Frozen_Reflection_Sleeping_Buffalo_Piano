* Programme Notes

Late December. Cold air from the Artic drifted slowly over Alberta, as temperatures reached a nose-chilling minus 30 degrees Celsius outside my hut in the woods. This piece stems from my work as a resident artist at the Banff Centre for the Arts and Innovation, Canada, in 2016. The project at the time was to work on a large-scale orchestral commission. However, whilst doing so, I discovered new possibilities for harmony on the piano by developing a compositional method which combines external resonances with my own choice of colours. This technique proved workable, and forms the backbone of this piece which I later composed at home in the UK in Jan 2017. Sparse, delicate and icy textures emerged: something from Banff appears to have soaked through into the music.

The score for this piece is licensed under creative commons, and is available on development platform GitHub. This permits others to make new versions or modify it -with attribution - according to their needs.

*** About the music

The piece is structured in two parts. Part one contains distant resonances, provided by e-bows -- an electro-mechanical device which serves to keep a single string vibrating indefinitely. These unusual sounds are gradually brought into focus, appearing within a sequence of harmonies designed to include them as seamlessly as possible. Small, isolated moments are set against a continuity of delicate drones, and tiny points of rhythm draw attention to subtle changes in the sonic landscape underneath them. This process poses many technical challenges for the performer, as the amount and timing of the additional resonances provided by the e-bows requires extremely precise control in addition to traditional piano techniques. The second section shows an alternative view; a reversal of this situation. Instead of building harmony on top of drone-like resonances as previously, I wanted to gradually fill out the negative-space around the drone-sounds with dense, chromatic writing. A subtle auditory effect results: at the end of busy passages, the resonance of the drone emerges during moments of rest where it can itself “modulate” the sound of the piano, from inside. Normal piano chords take on a transparent, shimmering quality during these silences-in-sound. A brief moment of recall closes the piece, once both main characters have been exposed. I feel that Charles Ives might have inspired me a little here.
 
/Frozen reflection, Sleeping Buffalo/ is written for Megumi Masaki. I am extremely grateful for her generous input during the compositional process, which has helped me shape and refine this piece.

* Video: Example performance

Megumi Masaki's 2018 performance of this piece is documented on youtube [[https://youtu.be/e2-Ndzyv6K0][here]] in full. Megumi is performing an earlier version of the work - which is similiar to the one downloadable here but without an additional section. This recording took place with a live audience on Feb 27th, 2018 at the University of York.

* Perform, share and make contributions

As this is GitHub, you are welcome to 'fork' this project (GitHub's term for your own linked copy) from which your changes and annotations will then be available to others when you decide they are ready. Your new versions or other changes can become part of this project if you so wish. Please let me know if you'd like help doing this. There is a useful explanation (aimed at a  developer audience [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5grYMXbAV0][here]]).

In addition to performing, you can modify the score and participate in further developing this piece. For this you will need your own account at GitHub ([[https://github.com/join][sign up here]]), and click the 'Fork' button which appears on this page. You'll then have your own copy, and it will link directly back to this original (preserving the terms of the creative commons license). You can change, make modifications, or scan in your PDF with comments and annotations. If you then make a 'pull-request', your changes can be merged back into the project and attributed. 

You can use the web, the GitHub desktop client, or enter this from your command line (terminal) app.

*If you simply wish to perform the work as is, then you don't need an account at GitHub*. Just download the zip (compressed archive file, which you'll need to unpack - your computer will most likely do this automatically) as above.

If you wish to modify the score, it is 'engraved' with the free, advanced music typesetting package [[http://lilypond.org/examples.html][Lilypond]]. Lilypond is a little like SCORE, in that it is a text-based score description language, and can render complex notation easily and beautifully. 

Finally, it is also possible to simply scan a marked up/annotated version of your copy of the score, add it as a PDF to your repository, and then submit a 'pull-request' from your GitHub desktop (or similar) app. I'll take a look at the changes and merge them in. Also, GitHub permits you to submit 'bugs' and 'issues': ideal for tracking any questions or comments you might have with rehearsing the work. Others will see these.
